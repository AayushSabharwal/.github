SciML Community Standards
=========================

The SciML community strongly values inclusivity and diversity. Everyone should treat others with the utmost respect. Everyone in the community must adhere to the
[NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) which reflects the values
of our community. Violations of the code should be reported to members of the steering
council, where the offenses will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
