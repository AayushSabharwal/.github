SciML Security Standards
=========================

# Reporting Security Issues

The SciML team and community take security bugs in SciML seriously. We appreciate your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl/security/advisories/new)
tab.

The SciML team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or
guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## The SciML Security Notification Process

Public notifications of vulnerabilities will be shared in
[community channels](https://sciml.ai/community/) and the
[official SciML news blog](https://sciml.ai/news/).
